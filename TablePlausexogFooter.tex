\item Note: The table displays the second stage coefficient from 2SLS regressions. Ocean wind speed is used to instrument for pirate attacks in the first stage, then predicted pirate attacks is used to predict land conflict. The coefficient on predicted piracy is shown. In both panels, the estimates allow for mild violations of the strict exclusion restriction by incorporating a parameter, $\gamma$, that allows ocean wind to directly affect land conflict, not through piracy. \cite{conley2012plausibly} shows that consistent estimates of the endogenous explanatory variable, piracy in this case, can be obtained in this manner in several ways. In Panel A, $\gamma$ is fixed to -0.06, because that is the estimate in Panel D, column 3 of \autoref{Table3PlaceboCountries}. The panel uses the union of confidence interval (UCI) method from \cite{conley2012plausibly}. In Panel B the local to zero method is used and a normal distribution assumed for $\gamma$. The mean of $\gamma$ is -0.06 and the variance is 0.0004, because this values causes the normalized difference in direct effects between the zero-first-stage group and the full sample to not exceed one-quarter in 95\% of the cases \citep{imbens2015causal}. This is the suggested variance by \cite{van2018beyond}.
